This repository contains the official code for the paper [Multi-Modal Multi-Granularity Tokenizer for Chu Bamboo Slips (Upcoming link)](https://arxiv.org/abs/).

Chu bamboo slips (CBS, Chinese: æ¥šç®€, pronounced as *chujian*) is an ancient Chinese script used during the Spring and Autumn period over 2,000 years ago. The study of which hold great significant value for understanding the history and culture of Ancient China. We scraped, processed, annotated, and then released the first large-scale dataset for machine learning community. It is named CHUBS, and contains over 100K annotated CBS characters. Additionally, we propose a novel multi-model multi-granularity tokenizer tailored for handling the large number of out-of-vocabulary characters in CBS (characters that have no modern Chinese equivalence).

## Data

All our datasets are provided at <https://huggingface.co/datasets/chen-yingfa/CHUBS>

It contains the following two parts.

1. The main dataset (CHUBS). Each example is an image of a CBS character and the correponding label. The label is the name of the directory that the image file belongs to.
2. A small part-of-speech (POS) tagging dataset of CBS text.

And, the file structure is as follows.

```
- glyphs.zip
- pos-tagging-data/
    - dev_examples.json
    - dev_examples_subchars.json
    - test_examples.json
    - test_exampels_subchars.json
    - train_examples.json
    - train_examples_subchars.json
```

CHUBS is contained within the `glyphs.zip` file while the latter is under the directory `pos-tagging-data`. The files with the `_subchars` suffix is the same data examples as the original file but each character is split into its sub-character components (see the paper for more details).

## Experiments

This repo contains three sets of experiments, each under its own directory.

1. [Character Recognition](char-recognition/README.md)
2. [Sub-Character Component Recognition](subchar-recognition/README.md)
3. [POS Tagging](pos-tagging/README.md)

## Copyright Concerns

As mentioned in the paper, the main CHUBS dataset is extracted and processed from existing openly available textbooks and quality-checked by our team. Compiling and analyzing such data is a common practice within the paleography field in ancient Chinese script, and we have consulted with legal experts to make sure that this data can be released under a permissive license such as Apache 2.0. The POS tagging data is annotated by our team, and also has no legal concerns related to its usage.
